Before your start
=================
MHAP requires a recent version of the `JVM <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html>`_ (1.8+). JDK 1.7 or earlier will not work. If you would like to build the code from source, you need to have the `JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`_ and the `ANT <http://ant.apache.org/>`_ build system available.

Prerequisites
==============
    * java (1.8+)
    * ant (1.8.2+)

Here is a list of currently supported Operating Systems:

1. Mac OSX (10.7 or newer)
2. Linux 64-bit (tested on CentOS, Fedora, RedHat, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu)
3. Windows (XP or newer)

Installation
======================
Pre-compiled
-----------------

The pre-compiled version is recommended to users who want to run MHAP, without doing development. To download a pre-compiled tar run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://github.com/marbl/MHAP/releases/download/v1.5b1/mhap-1.5b1.tar.gz

And if ``wget`` not available, you can use ``curl`` instead:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -L https://github.com/marbl/MHAP/releases/download/v1.5b1/mhap-1.5b1.tar.gz > mhap-1.5b1.tar.gz

Then run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tar xvzf mhap-1.5b1.tar.gz

Source
-----------------

To build the code from the release:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://github.com/marbl/MHAP/archive/v1.5b1.zip

If you see a certificate not trusted error, you can add the following option to wget:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ --no-check-certificate

And if ``wget`` not available, you can use ``curl`` instead:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -L https://github.com/marbl/MHAP/archive/v1.5b1.zip > v1.5b1.zip

You can also browse the https://github.com/marbl/MHAP/tree/v1.5b1
and click on Downloads. 

Once downloaded, extract to unpack:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ unzip v1.5b1.zip

Change to MHAP directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd MHAP-1.5b1

Once inside the MHAP directory, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ant

This will compile the program and create a target/mhap-1.5b1.jar file which you can use to run MHAP. The quick-start instructions assume you are in the target directory when running the program. You can also use the target/mhap-1.5b1.tar file to copy MHAP to a different system or directory.
